# Frog Rush üê∏
Frog Rush is a game coded in the Processing language for SFU's IAT 167 course designed and made by me.

## How to play
Catch as many frogs as you can within 60 seconds!
You earn more points for each frog you catch without missing and
if you manage to catch 10 frogs in a row, you'll enter FROG RUSH
and you'll earn even more points per frog!
